# Overview
ASAUM - *Adaptive Structured and Unstructured Mesh* - is a C++ library for representing distributed, multi-block structed and unstructured meshes.
The library is meant to provide users with the ability to read/write, partition, and query the large
distributed meshes that are commonly used in scientific computing.
